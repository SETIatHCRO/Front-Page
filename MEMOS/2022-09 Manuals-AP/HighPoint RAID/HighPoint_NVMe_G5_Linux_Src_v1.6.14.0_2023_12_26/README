  `- hptnvme_g5_linux_src_vx.x.x_xx_xx_xx.bin : driver for NVMe RAID controller

#############################################################################
3. Installation
#############################################################################

  1)  Extract the source package to a temporary directory.

  2)  Change to the temporary directory.

  3)  Run the .bin file to install the driver package.

    # sh hptnvme_g5_linux_src_vxx.x.x_xx_xx_xx.bin

  NOTES:

    The installer requires super user's permission to run the installation.
  So if you are not logged in as root, please supply the password of root to
  start the installation.

    The installer will check and install build tools if some of them is missing.
  A network connection is required to install the build tools. The following
  tools are checked by the installer:

    gcc
    make
    perl

    They are installed automatically when you select "Software Development
  Workstation" group in the installation of RHEL/CentOS 6.

    When packages are installed from network, it may take too long to complete
  the installation as it depends on the network speed. The packages could be
  installed first to omit the network issue by following command:

    # yum install gcc make perl

    If the installer failed to find or install the required build tools, the
  installation will be terminated without any change to the system.

    The installer will install folders and files to /usr/share/hptdrv/hptnvme.

    At the end of the installation, the installer will build driver module hptnvme
  for all kernels in the system.

    And the auto build script will be invoked to build driver module for kernels
  added automatically when system reboot or shutdown.
	
  Notice:

    The instructions above are all about installing the driver automatically. If you want to
  compile and load driver manually, the following instructions are ready for you.	 
	
    Attention: If you want to load hptnvme driver, before that you have to unbind the nvme disk attached to adapter from the nvme driver. 
  Here is an example. Use the command "lspci | grep memory" to query nvme SSD information, such as "01:00.0 Non-Volatile memory controller". 
  Then enter the /sys/bus/pci/drivers/nvme directory and find that there is a soft link named 0000:01:00.0 that matches the nvme SSD information queried before.
  Finally, use the command "echo -n "0000:01:00.0" > unbind" to unbind the nvme device.
  

    Decompress .bin file to get an open source code directory by following command:

    # ./hptnvme_g5_linux_src_vxx.x.x_xx_xx_xx.bin --noexec --target hptnvme 
					 
    Enter to directory hptnvme and compile source code to get a module by following commands:

    # cd hptnvme/product/hptnvme/linux/

    # make

    Load the hptnvme.ko by executing the following command:

    # insmod hptnvme.ko
    
    Remove the hptnvme.ko by executing the following command:

    # rmmod hptnvme.ko
	

#############################################################################
4. Uninstallation
#############################################################################

    Run hptuninhptnvme as root to uninstall driver for NVMe RAID controller.

    This command will delete all files installed to the system previously,
  except the package(s) installed to support driver compilation.
