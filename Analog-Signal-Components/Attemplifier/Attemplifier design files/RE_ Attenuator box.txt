Peter,
We are noticing that we need a little more height inside the box (pocket).
 I propose that we make the overall thickness of the box 0.550 instead of
0.525.  This will make the pocket depth 0.425 instead of 0.400.  Daning is
not in today, so we cannot easily change the drawings.
Thanks,
Ed


Hi Peter and Matt,

The one dimension of the box is extended from 1.05 to 1.38 to accomodate
the channel.  One additional hole, 4-40 next to the 6-40's on the side of
the box.  Any other changes that show up, please check with us first.

The channel is a way to prevent the feed-thru pins from shorting to
anything, by recessing them.

Thanks,

Ed
