NOTES: NOTES-powerfail 2018-05-16

HCRO had 3 separate utility power losses on 5/15/2018 
(lightening storms --- not sure how close) at ~12:15, 15:00, and 16:15 
The backup UPS/generator system would appear to have correctly covered during 
the first 2 losses, but failed on the third event. The Automatic Transfer 
Switch (ATS) had a short, failing to start the generator and hence no power 
into the UPS, which after 19 minutes (~16:39) ran out of backup battery supply.

At 10:00 2018-05-16 We put the system into manual coverage. Note that this 
means that should we have another utility power loss, we will need to manually 
switch on the generator and activate the equivalent switch in the ATS. 

TIMING Rack:
       Digital Logger power conditioner (timingps - 10.3.0.215) - one half appears not to work
       Rubidium Clock - took a long time to sync the 1PPS, but eventually it
       did

CONTROL Racks:
	Boot2 SW Raid is degraded. See notes specific to that
	Basalt, SVN - power supplies either failed or their power bays are 
	  suspect. Left power supply is primary. Right is redundant.
	Bfb (old) netgear switch died.
ANTS:
	ant1k  will not cool past 125. Have shutoff per minex recommendation
	ant2a  after power outage not cooling 48 volt doesnt seem to turn anything
	on. Has been shut off
	ant2h  will not cool past 90. Have shutoff per minex recommendation
	ant3l  noisy before but cooling, now after power outage not cooling 48 volt doesnt seem ...
	ant4j will not cool past 125. Have shutoff per minex recommendation
