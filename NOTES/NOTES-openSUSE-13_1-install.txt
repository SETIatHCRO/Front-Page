	 openSUSE 13.1,Server,64-bit,ATA Server - 1/5/16
	 openSUSE 13.2, ATA Server 64-bitx86 1/5/16


PRE-CONDITIONS:
- If HW RAID, then VD created. If no HW RAID controller, then system will
  define separate partitions for each physical disks (?)
- IP address defined within DNS
- Firewall rules setup appropriately if necessary (DMZ servers)
- using ISO image (autoyast), OpenSuSE 13.1 Server, 64-bit, ATA Server
  created in susestudio 
    0.0.1  -  install w/ automatic update of config files (problematic)
    0.0.2  - install w/o updated config files (11/17/14)
YAST:
Initial boot will be to autoyast. Yast commands are alt-<letter>. 
Yast doesn't seem to be supported like it once was. There are bugs and
incompleteness in the script. May have to edit files directly.


FIRSTBOOT:
  Network Setup (within autoyast). See /etc/sysconfig/network)
    1. Hostname: <host> Domain: hcro.org [/etc/hosts ] - note there is a bug
  in yast script here...does not enter fqdn. see step below
    2. uncheck "change hostname via DHCP. Ensure all global DHCP options are off
    3. Host, Routing, Eth card configurations
       name servers: 10.3.0.41 10.3.0.42 [/etc/resolv.conf]
	 IPv4 gw: 10.3.0.1
	 mask: 255.255.0.0


INITIAL LOGIN:
    - passwd (root password will be "linux". Set to standard password
    - ifconfig to check network interface
      	       systemctl status network.service
    - check date
      TZ=US/Pacific
    - ensure ethernet interface device name is consistent in network settings.
       	 i.e., "eno1" for consistency across servers (ensure there is no "-"
	 left in the entry field.
	 [/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eno1]
    - check /etc/hosts for fqdn on the local host entries...possibly one of the
      yast scripts is culprit in not correctly writing out this file at some
      point. This will cause processes like automount to fail.

CONFIGURATION:
    1. get tar'ed config files from tumulus:/root/admin/opensuse13_1_files.tar
        mkdir tmp; cd tmp
        tar -xvf <file> 
      [NOTE - originally had this automatically installed, but there is a startup
      dependency order that breaks. Also, the config files are for obs subnet
      hosts only, i.e., those utilizing ldap)
    2. Copy the config files
       - NB: the resolv.conf  should be
    the same if the autoyast setup went correctly.


  Services
    - All nodes
      	  - ensure that services are running: service <service> status
	  xinetd
	  nfsserve
	  rpcbind
	  rsyncd
	  autofs
    - DMZ nodes
        disable LDAP client
        modify /etc/resolv.conf to use ns1 (74.43.140.11) instead of 10.3 ns servers

DATA Disk config (i.e., VD1)
  1. create mount point directories
      /data - e.g., a dmz machine
      # mkdir /exports/<hostname> - e.g., machine that will export its data disk

  2. Create disk partition
      # 
      # fdisk /dev/sdb
         Command (m for help): n            ! add a new partition
         Partition type:
           p   primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free)
           e   extended
      Select (default p): p
      Partition number (1-4, default 1):
      First sector (2048-570949631, default 2048):
      Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G} (2048-570949631, default 570949631):
      Command (m for help): w               ! write table to disk and exit
  3. Format disk
       # mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1
  4. Create fstab entry
  DMZ:  /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-360019b90b48722001bdbf5c96527dc77-part1 /data xfs defaults 1 2   
  OBS:  /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-360019b90b48722001bdbf5c96527dc77-part1
			/exports/<host> xfs defaults,noatime,nodiratime 0 0   
  5. IF DMZ  then mount /data 
  6. IF OBS then mounted via automounter. See II.1 of NOTES-ldap.txt (repeated here)
     - create a <host>.auto.data.ldif (see examples in NOTEs/ldap/
       NOTE the syntax of ldif file is very particular. Best to copy a working
  one and edit.
      - (on basalt) service ldap reload
     # ldapadd -x -D 'cn=Administrator,dc=obs,dc=hcro,dc=org' -W -f <host>.auto.data.ldif
     # service ldap force-reload

    
  7. (OBS) edit the /etc/exports file
     /exports/<host>
     127.0.0.2/8(rw,root_squash,no_subtree_check,async,wdelay,insecure)
     10.3.0.0/16(rw,root_squash,no_subtree_check,async,wdelay,insecure)
     - restart the nfsserver

DELL DRAC4     - remote access over the remote access eth port on Dell 2950
     Hosts RAC interface accessed on 10.3.6.##  where ## is the same last
     number as in IP address

     RAC FW Version

	 1.6 - uses java  (haven't gotten working yet) -- on subr072 10.3.6.55

		  -> Sites -> select 'Automatically detect intranet network'
		  
        look for popup about security warning and add site to list of
        exceptions (i.e., have no certificate)

        Tools->Internet Options->Security tab->select 'Internet' -> Custom
        Level (button) -> Activate control and plug-ins --> Automatic
        prompting for ActiveX control --> set to Enable



PROBLEMS
	- network doesn't come up after reboot - check that the
	network.service is running
	- nfsserver not present - requires autofs, rpcbind to be running.
