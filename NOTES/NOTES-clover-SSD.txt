Modify I/O Scheduler - NOT DONE
  Change from cfq to noop or deadline

    # cat /sys/block/sdX/queue/scheduler
        noop deadline [cfq]

Confirm BIOS Settings
  SATA Mode [AHCI Mode]
  Aggressive Link Power Mgmt [Enabled]

Steps:
1) mkdir /scratch  (chown obs:obs)
2) modify /etc/fstab
/dev/disk/by-id/ata-Samsung_SSD_850_PRO_1TB_S1SRNWAFB05385D-part1 /scratch ext4 defaults,noatime,nodiratime 0 0

  Note - at this time NOT using the discard mount option which will trim 
  (erase) the SSD as soon as a file is deleted. Alternatively trim can be
 done at boot or by a cron job, or as step in usage (e.g., at end of 
    processing)

3) parted /dev/sdc
    mklabel   gpt
    mkpart primary ext4
      start? 0%
      end?  100%
4) mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdc1
    Note - using the default block size (512). Did we want to consider 4k?
5) mount -a

6) setup rsync destination
  - ensure the rsyncd is enabled on clover
  - modify /etc/rsyncd.conf
      - comment out the hosts allow from original. May revisit access control
      - add scratch module
      [scratch]
              uid = obs
              gid = obs
              path = /scratch
              comment = space for image processing
              read only = false
