NOTES:  HCRO Backups
DATE:   1/8/2014
AUTHOR: ELK
MODS:	6/4/15	ELK	Add description of level 2 (B) backup of basalt rdiff roots to muleears
			Add description of backups from muleears to ata-mp-mirror
			Add description of obs data backup to muleears.
      7/27/15 Add ~obs/NOTES (home dir is on /data/basalt/home)
      10/3117 ELK       Change ldap,autofs service startup order. Problem was
      autofs is starting before the ldap server and consequently fails when
      trying to access the ldap server (which is local.

----------------------------------------
HCRO has a 2-level backup process.

Nightly backups are handled by using the software rdiff-backup. This software 
uses the rsync libraries to create difference change sets (incrementals) based 
on a baseline which is mirrored. Once a month a copy of these rdiff files (the 
mirror and the incremental files) is copied to a "remote" host. The creation of
a mirror sets the baseline date from which no earlier history can be retrieved.

Level 1:
Files are stored on a RAID5 array on host basalt under /exports/basalt/backup.
The script is /exports/basalt/backup/support/dobackups and is invoked at 23:00 nightly.
The roots backed up in this method are generally assumed to be the dynamic roots of ATA.
There are several static roots that are not a part of this nightly process. See table below 
of all roots addressed in backup. Files older than 52 weeks are culled. 

NOTE - due to install of a new svn host, the rdiff incompatibility between basalt (SUSE LE10) 
and svn (OpenSUSE 12.3) requires that a hot-copy of the svn repos be created and copied over 
to basalt, and then the rdiff being done locally on basalt from that temporary hot-copy. 

Level 2:
(A) A copy of critical backup roots is rsynced to the host buttercup in lab2. This includes the 
nightly-generated rdiff files (although not all), and several static roots that are not included in 
level1 backups. Lab2 is considered to be sufficiently remote for purposes of fire, but likely 
not adequate for earthquake events.
The script on buttercup, ~/admin/backup/dobackups_2l.sh, is a pull (buttercup initiates) [works better given
rsync library incompatibilities between basalt and buttercup]

(B) A copy of the rdiff roots (svn, boot, obs/{bin,sri-scripts,seti-scripts})
is rsynced to muleears::/volume1/exports/backups. The script on basalt,
/exports/basalt/backup/support/dobackups_2l.sh,
is a push from basalt to muleears

Level 3: 
The svn (rdiff level2 backup) root on muleears is pulled by ata-mp-mirror and stored in
ata-mp-mirror:/volume1/exports/backups. See description below of the
ata-mp-mirror scripts

OBSERVATION DATA:
- (Level 1) Observers maintain custom scripts to push observation data to the
muleears::/volume1/exports/obs dirs using the rsync daemon on muleears
- (Level 2) ata-mp-mirror in MP will pull the observation data from
mulears::/volume1/exports/obs/??
and store on ata-mp-mirror::/volume1/exports/obs/

------------------------------------------------------------------
ATA-MP-MIRROR scripts
- a user account "rsync" exists on ata-mp-mirror to contain the scripts, 
logs, and key related to our custom backups. NOTE - for now all scripts are 
owned and run as root
-An account mirror-rsync has been created on blake7 and public key installed. The
private key is in the ata-mp-mirror rsync users .ssh dir
- An ssh tunnel thru the hcro bastion host by the script
~rsync/bin/tunnelwatchdog.sh
which executes the tunnelkeepalive script.
- the script runrsync rsyncs the desired roots from muleears: obs, backups/svn/ata
 
------------------------------------------------------------------
RESTORING
       
There are two ways to tell rdiff-backup to restore a file or directory.
The first would be to run rdiff-backup on a mirror file and use the -r or 
--restore-as-of options.  The second option would be to run rdiff-back
on an increment file.

1. Restore from mirror file

For example, suppose in the past you have run:

    rdiff-backup /data/tumulus/obs/bin /exports/basalt/backup/obs/bin

to  back  up the obs bin directory into the backup directory, and now
want a copy of the obs bin directory the  way  it  was  3  days  ago
placed at a temporary location

One way to do this is to run:

    rdiff-backup -r 3D /exports/basalt/backup/obs/bin /tmp/obsbin.old

where  above the "3D" means 3 days (for other ways to specify the time,
see the TIME FORMATS section). The /exports/basalt/backup/obs/bin  
directory  was selected,  because that is the directory containing the 
current version of /data/tumulus/obs/bin.

Note that the option to --restore-as-of always specifies an exact time.
(So  "3D" refers to the instant 72 hours before the present.)  If there
was no backup made  at  that  time,  rdiff-backup  restores  the  state
recorded  for the previous backup.  For instance, in the above case, if
"3D" is used, and there are only backups from 2 days and  4  days  ago,
/usr/local as it was 4 days ago will be restored.

2. Restore from incremental file
