NOTES: Feeds -- all things about them
DATE:  20 Aug 2015


FEED Config:
	New feeds have new firmware and hardware configurations that require
	special case handling. Among these are different feed focus boundaries 
	and low-level driver I/O.

	Config files for versioning are kept in
	$ATA_HOME/etc/antenna-config.xml


FEED UPGRADE:
     After install of a new version feed, the config needs to be updated.

     - modify the version in the antenna-config.xml file
     - restart RecoveryServer, AntennaServer (as atasys)
       	       >  ataps -c restart -p RecoveryServer
     - reboot the antenna (as atasys)
       	       >  ataantsyscntl -r <ant>


FEED LOCATIONS:
     Minex delivers a Factory Feed Report with each new or repaired feed.
     Included in the report are the factory defined LNA biases. These 
     feed locations and biases are kept in config files to allow automated 
     periodic maintenance checks to ensure LNAs are maintaining their factory 
     settings. Due to the many versions of LNAs, the ruleset for how to update
     the biases varies. Refer to NOTES-LNAbias.txt
