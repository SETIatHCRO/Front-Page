However, this feature is only supported with a set of UPSes:
See
Synology Compatible UPS: https://www.synology.com/en-us/knowledgebase/faq/300

What was noted when trying to enable UPS support [Control Panel/UPS]
was a return message of "Cannot connect to the network UPS Server"

With that "Enable UPS support" box checked (although failed), noted 
the following processed running on muleears: snmpd, upsd, and upsmon.
Once the "Enable UPS support" was unchecked, the upsd and upsmon processes
went away.

The config files for these ups processes are in /usr/syno/etc/ups
The config file for the snmpd is /usr/syno/etc
