TITLE: 5e Elevation offset pointing model update

See http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf2-2.php for a description of telescope reference systems

-------------------------------------------------------------
8/26/13 Elevation values reported as bad and AZ wrapping

E.g., antenna at 180 18 but reporting 180 64.20

Instructions from Gerry are:
 Gerry says ".atafindencoders., then drive the elevation down to the lower limit and change the fixed offset elevation value in the pointing model file to be 16.5 degrees. .atareloadpm..  Then we will need to do a pointing run with .atapointer. (suck the text file that is created into TPOINT and generate a REAL pointing model for the dish)."  

 1. initial attempt to setvelocity to drive down would not move the ant - 
    the servostatus was reporting problem
 2. rebooted, atafindencoders antenna el at approx. 35 but reporting 80.94
 3. atasetvelocity 5e 0 -1
 4. ant resting at el low limit
      Az Nominal
      El Servo:
          Attempting to Stop Motor.
          Motor Brake Active.
          PWM Outputs Disabled.
          Following Error.
          Amplifier Fault.
          Following Error.

      ant5e  180.299  64.201

--------------------------------------------------------------
9/17-18/13  Run atapointer

1. 5e is at lower el limit (from above steps) - 180 64
2. modified the elevation offset in production pointing model file to be 16.5 (formerly 213.838) 
  as atasys@maincntl - file in /opt/atasys/data/Pointing/PointModel_ant5e.dat
  Before  AzOffset = 33.533
          ElOffset = 213.838
  After:  AzOffset = 33.533
          ElOffset = 16.5

3. atareloadpm 5e  
    Note that the az/el changed to 192 501  (why did azimuth reading change?)
    although the actual setting is 180 ~16.5
4. atapointer run
    set-defaults-new.csh y fx64a
    atasetskyfreq a 1575
    atasetskyfreq b 1575
    atasetskyfreq c 1575
    atasetskyfreq d 1575
    atapointer test 5e a --lo b --stophour 18.00

    Failed because antenna could not reach position and was set offline.

5. parked the antenna - correctly moves to 180 on az, but is reporting 192.
    does not move in elevation (because of servo fault per above) and reports 500
3. Run atatpointer - 

SYNOPSIS
    atapointer filename ant correlator [OPTIONS]
    DESCRIPTION
        Acquires radio pointing data from GPS or single radio source.
        EXAMPLES
            A regular pointing run on all available GPS satellites
                output file name suffix = thursday, antenna = 3d, both polarizations, correlator A
                      atapointer thursday 3d A
                      OPTIONS
                          --obj obj
                                  name of object to track continuously (default uses GPS list)
      --lo lo
              which LO to query for frequency (default a)
      --freq freq
              set frequency to given value before starting (default = use current)
      --niters niters
              number of iterations on target before quitting (default = infinite)
      --stophour stophour
              local hour-of-day when program should exit (default = never)
      -q
              quiet mode: no error or status messages
      -v
              verbose (diagnostic) mode
