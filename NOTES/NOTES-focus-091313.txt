Feed focus going into "not calibrated" state when commanded to <=1400

Standard test
1. setfocus 3000 --cal  (typically feed are in not calibrated state before start)
2. setfocus 1000        (sw should truncate the request to 1400 and focus should stop there)
3. setfocus 500         (again, sw should truncate, and feed should not move as already there)
4. setfocus 3000        (should move back to ~6" out)

- If the full extension limit is too sensitive, then step 2 will put the feed into "not calibrated"
- This occurred on 1d,1f,2f. 2e behaved correctly for all commands
- Adjusted the limit "switch" one full turn less sensitive (tried 1/2 turn on 1d, but it wasn't
    enough. This corrected the problem.
- 2f however, failed on step 4 and went to "not calibrated" yet stopped in the approx. 3000
setting position (~ 6" out). This will need to be investigated further
- 2c was not in out test list, but while out in the field, heard it make feed extension
noise. Upon checking, the setting should have been at 1400 per others in the observation set. 
Instead the feed was in the "not calibrated" state (but likely fully extended to desired position).

- Observations
  - Feed focuses were getting within ~5-30 of desired setting when they would go into
    not calibrated, so only a small adjustment was needed.
  - Hence, observations at 1400 should be okay. However, the next focus request will take
    a longer time to get to desired position as the feed, in an unknown "not calibrated" state
    will first move in a direction (seems to be in the direction of the last movement) in
    an attempt to calibrate itself (i.e.,fully retract) before moving to desired position. 
    Thus in our testing, if step 2 resulted in not calibrated, then next command the feed
    would first go further out, then fully retract (calibrate) and go to desired position,
    and it took quite a while to get it done... 

=======================================================
09/20/13 - Testing of 2c Feed focus

- Observations
  - would not retract for explicit calibration command - instead was extending
  - would extend when expecting it to retract upon command, e.g., at 3000, command to 4000
  - The capacitor (mounted w/ a resistor) is accessed from behind feed mount
  - replaced the capacitor and now correctly operating
