NOTES: Basalt machine changeover
DATE: 27 Apr 2016

The former basalt machine (SuperMicro) was replaced w/ a Dell PowerEdge
2950. The SuperMicro machine had been exhibiting unreliability starting
with failed motherboard in July 2015 (replaced), and RAID degradation 
(twice - resolved by reseating disks and rebuilding RAID). 

The basalt machine provides the following services and shared mounts:
  LDAP Server (Master w/ replication on boot2)
     - for user authentication
     - for shared mount
  DNS (ns3)
  Backups (see notes on backups)
  Shared Mounts (on /exports/basalt)
       /home  - user home dirs
       /hcro/opt - optional package installs
       /hcro/miriad - miriad

PREPARATION:
- configuration of Dell PowerEdge w/ 13.1 (see notes on substitutemachines)
- nightly rsync archive of the /exports/basalt directories onto 
  substitute machine
- export of primary LDAP (bdb) database:
    > slapcat -b "dc=obs,dc=hcro,dc=org" -l /tmp/contents.ldif

OFFLINE SETUP:
Network
	- configure machine name, dns, and IP info (via yast)

LDAP
	- copy SSL certificates from old basalt (/etc/ssl/servercerts &
	/etc/ssl/certs/YaST-CA.pem)
	Note that these certificates are expired (self authorized) and
	while the LDAP is configured for TLS/SSL, all access is internal
	so not using the SSL features (??). For ease, opted to use same
	key pair. Copied into same location.
	- via yast, configured remaining ldap parms (database type bdb).
	Info is stored in configuration backend (see slapd-config(5))
	This started up the slapd, but it had an empty database. Shutdown
	the slapd. 
	- import ldap database contents
	  >slapadd -l /tmp/contents.ldif

Mounts	
	- needed to unmount the substitute machine partition that 
	contained the /exports/basalt dirs so that it could be renamed
	/exports/basalt
	- edit the substitute machine /etc/fstab and /etc/exports to
	properly refer to the mounts
	  /etc/exports
		/exports/basalt 10.3.0.0/16(rw,no_root_squash,async,wdelay)
		/exports/basalt/home 10.3.0.0/16(rw,root_squash,wdelay,no_subtree_check,async)
		/exports/basalt/hcro 10.3.0.0/16(rw,no_root_squash,async,wdelay,no_subtree_check,async)
	- edit /etc/auto.master to include the line
	    +auto.master
	  NBBBB - this seems to be required in 13.1 but was commented out in
	  all 10.* hosts except atadb...

Services
	- Ensure all the needed services are enabled (done via Yast)
	  - autofs   - nfs, (nfsserver??, nfsboot??)
	  - cron     - ntp
	  - ldap     
	  - named

NAGIOS
	- create user and group nagios
	- get the /etc/init.d/nrpe  script
 Add nrpe to the list of system services and have it automatically start when the system boots.

chkconfig --add nrpe
chkconfig nrpe on

BACKUPS
	- add backup jobs to the crontab (root)
0 23 * * * /exports/basalt/backups/support/dobackups
0 3 * * * /exports/basalt/backups/support/dobackups_2l.sh

EXTRA DIRS
~root/admin  - copy this dir of scripts
