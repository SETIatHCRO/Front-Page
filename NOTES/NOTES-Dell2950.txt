NOTES:  Dell 2950 management notes
2018-08-03 - Added in notes for converting RAID from 0 to 1 on AH machine

Upgrade PERC 5/i HW RAID Ctrllr FW:
  1) Use OMSA 7.4 LiveCD. 
  2) Upon bootup, a pop-up labeled "Inventory and Update Firmware" will come up. It will 
  take a while for the inventory to complete and be displayed on the popup.
  3) A browser will also popup and possibly fail to connect to "127.0.0.1:1311", but a 
  retry and it will connect -- But don't know a password that will get in...so ignore browser
  4) After inventory complete, select desired components to update"
    - BIOS
    - SAS/SATA Backplane
    - PERC 5/i
    All other items failed -- to be investigated later.

Install OMSA - OpenManager Server Administration
  See https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Dell_OMSA
  Follow instructions for appropriate OS.

        Device contains neither a valid DOS partition table, nor Sun, SGI or OSF disklabel
        Building a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0xa36c2f98.
        Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
        After that, of course, the previous content won't be recoverable.


        The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 71079.
        There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
        and could in certain setups cause problems with:
        1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
        2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
          (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)
        Warning: invalid flag 0x0000 of partition table 4 will be corrected by w(rite)
