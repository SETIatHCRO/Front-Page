General
-----------------------------------
HCRO uses NTP to synchronize servers to common UTC time.

NTP is a collection of protocols, programs and servers used to keep time on 
computers distributed on a network. The goal of NTP is to keep each computer 
as close to UTC as possible. 

For indepth information on NTP, see: http://www.ntp.org/

HCRO currently has the following NTP servers defined
ntp1-1 - aeon (stratum 1)   10.3.0.49
##ntp1-2 - chronology         10.3.0.46 -- OOS
ntp1-3
ntp1-4 - unavco-gps
ntp2-1 - basalt (stratum 2)
ntp2-2 - auxcntl

[FOLLOWING SECTION IS OBE 3/23/15]
ntp1-1 aka aeon is a 1U server running FreeBSD 6.2 and synchronizes against the CNS Clock I on the first of two RS232 ports in the back of the CNS Clock.  The system is in the Time and Frequency Distribution rack. The CNS Clock is based on a Motorola OnCore GPS chipset. Drivers are provided with the general NTP release that can communicate directly with the OnCore chip. This allows aeon to receive current UTC in a binary format over the serial port while also using the DCD RS232 line for 1PPS. This allows for µs level accuracy on this system. NTP is using the PPSAPI (RFC-2783) specification for handling 1PPS. Round trip latency to this server on the Obs LAN is usually ~0.2-0.5ms. 

ntp1-2 is the Meinberg device. [The former host used at this name, a SunBlade 15000 
running solaris, failed in spring 2013.] The Meinberg has a GPS receiver. 

ntp1-3 aka atantp.csr.seti.org is currently no connected. TBD

ntp1-4 aka unavco-gps.hcro.org is a Trimble NetRS device used by UNAVCO for 
measuring crustal plate movements and deformation. The NetRS is not a particularly 
good stratum 1 source of time keeping. It comes pre-configured to offer NTP 
service, but if you dig into what it is doing, it appears the instance of ntp 
running on the device synchronizes to GPS via a serial link between the local 
linux host OS and the GPS receiver. This increases the RMS to ~20ms and offsets
from UTC of ~5ms.


From NTP FAQ
"Of course the final achievable accuracy depends on the time source being used. 
Basically, no client can be more accurate than its server. In addition the quality 
of network connection also influences the final accuracy. Slow and non predictable 
networks with varying delays are very bad for good time synchronization.

A time difference of less than 128ms between server and client is required to maintain 
NTP synchronization. The typical accuracy on the Internet ranges from about 5ms to 100ms, 
possibly varying with network delays. A recent survey[2] suggests that 90% of the NTP 
servers have network delays below 100ms, and about 99% are synchronized within one second 
to the synchronization peer.

With PPS synchronization an accuracy of 50µs and a stability below 0.1 PPM is achievable o

HCRO goal would be an offset of 0.004 msec (4 usec) [according to Colby]

I. ntpq - examining status
----------------------------------------------
auxcntl:~ # ntpq -p
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
     ==============================================================================
     *aeon.hcro.org   .GPS.            1 u  364 1024  377    4.259    0.029   0.027
     +chronology.hcro .PPS.            1 u 1018 1024  377    4.288    0.011   0.061
      basalt.hcro.org 10.3.0.49        2 u  547 1024  337    0.076   -0.021   0.247




Columns Defined:
remote: peers speficified in the ntp.conf file
* = current time source
# = source selected, distance exceeds maximum value
o = source selected, Pulse Per Second (PPS) used
+ = source selected, included in final set
x = source false ticker
. = source selected from end of candidate list
- = source discarded by cluster algorithm
blank = source discarded high stratum, failed sanity

refid: remote source.s synchronization source

stratum: stratum level of the source

t: types available
l = local (such as a GPS, WWVB)
  u = unicast (most common)
  m = multicast
  b = broadcast
  - = netaddr

  when: number of seconds passed since last response

  poll: polling interval, in seconds, for source

  reach: indicates success/failure to reach source, 377 all attempts successful

  delay: indicates the roundtrip time, in milliseconds, to receive a reply

  offset: indicates the time difference, in milliseconds, between the client server and source

  disp/jitter: indicates the difference, in milliseconds, between two samples


II. ntpdc 
    
   ntpdc -c loopinfo     - display the combined offset in seconds, as seen at the last poll.  

   auxcntl:~ # ntpdc -c loopinfo/usr/
   offset:               0.000132 s
   frequency:            -31.546 ppm
   poll adjust:          30
   watchdog timer:       1246 s

   ntpdc -c kerninfo      - display the current remaining correction, just as ntptime does.

   auxcntl:~ # ntpdc -c kerninfo
   pll offset:           0.00012 s
   pll frequency:        -31.546 ppm
   maximum error:        0.251044 s
   estimated error:      3.9e-05 s
   status:               0001  pll
   pll time constant:    6
   precision:            1e-06 s
   frequency tolerance:  512 ppm

III. Recovery after outage/server down

Aeon:
  As of 3/23/15 the CNS II is now commissioned as "Aeon" our stratum 1
  clock source. The older CNS clock is on standby and not currently used.
  It may take some time for the CNS II to resync w/ the GPS satellites
  if it has been w/o power for some time. 

  IS 1PPS led sufficient to indicate sync w/ satellites, or do we need
  to use the PC-based Tac application to determine GPS sync???

Other nodes
  1. Stop the ntpd 
  2. Force the clock to update to a reference clock, e.g., Now w/ the CNS II
    then will want to use it (aeon) as the reference clock. The only other
    stratum 1 is the unavco, but it is not as reliable and is not under UPS.

      # ntpdate <reference clock>
 
    3. Restart the daemon using the -g (panic) and -x (slew) switches
        (mingus/openbsd) ntpd -x -g

6/9/16 - Align the NTP configurations

Have done following changes per karto (most in /etc/ntp.conf):

(Production) Servers:

    - remove references to ntp1-2 (aka ntp1-6). These were historical. 
    We no longer redundancy for our internal stratum 1 (since aeon died 
    and we moved to CNS2 for our ntp1-1)
    - remove references to ntp1-4. This is the unavco GPS source, and 
    it drifts and throws things off
    - remove references to berkeley time servers
    - add references to below after ntp1-1

        server nist-time-server.eoni.com    iburst
        server utcnist2.colorado.edu   iburst

    - change references to auxcntl (ntp2-2) and basalt (ntp2-1) from 
    "server" to "peer"
    - ensure that ntp startup uses ntp1-1.hcro.or for initial query 
    (this in /etc/sysconfig/ntp)


Correlator boards:

    - same as above, plus
    - add "iburst prefer" to ntp1-1.hcro.org server reference
    - keep internal peer references to other boards
