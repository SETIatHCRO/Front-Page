NOTES-Server Transition

Sept 2017 - Preparation for transition from Sunfire control servers to Dell
c6100
Oct/Nov 2017 - transition of antcntl to control

PREVIEW
9/6/17 power event caused failure of boot2 and auxcntl
NB - all production root changes should be done in sandbox and checked into
svn and then copied into the production root.
Move auxcntl and maincntl jsda processes to atadb. Use maincntl for boot2

BOOT2
	- these disks were recovered and booted up in the maincntl chassis
	  - RAID: edited the /etc/mdadm.conf to have proper UUID for the md0 and md1
	  - NETWORK: renamed the /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth-id-<MAC address> 
	  (openSUSE 10.2 would define the if config file based on the mac>
	  to that of the (maincntl) chassis, namely 00:1b:24:2d:e5:05
	  - PXE DHCP: edit the MAC for the eth0 rule in 
	  /etc/udev/rules.d/30-net_persistent_names.rules to new MAC for eth0.
	  (The dhcp pxe refers to eth0, so need that address map to be
	  correct)
	  - LDAP/SLURPD - boot2 had been set up as an ldap server w/
	  replication. That service has been stopped. HOWEVER, need to remove
	  references in client /etc/ldap.conf and /etc/openldap/ldap.conf to this secondary server. The
	  client would only try to use this secondary if it could not get to
	  the primary (basalt). 
	  - DNS resolv.conf - use atadb address (10.3.0.74) as first in
	  list. Edit all obs hosts /etc/resolv.conf. Edit the SBC boot files
	  (boot2:/fxa/{f,x}[1-2]/etc/resolv.conf
	  

AUXCNTL/ATADB
	- JSDA: move jsda processes to atadb (edit atadb processes.xml)
	- SYSLOG-NG: copy the auxcntl /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf to atadb ???WHAT
	ELSE??
	- MIRIAD: formerly physically mounted at
	auxcntl:/export/auxcntl/miriad, with a link defined as
	/export/miriad. The ldap then pointed to auxcntl:/export/miriad. NB:
	the /etc/exports file has only the /export/auxcntl in it. The link
	allows us to fake out the ldap automount to think that /export/miriad
	is a separate mount (why this was done I am not sure)
  	    cat /sunfires/auxcntl/md0/etc/exports
	    /export/auxcntl 10.3.0.0/16(rw,root_squash,no_subtree_check,async,wdelay,inse                                                cure)
 	 - NETWORK: set the routes for ibob routing:
	   	    # more routes
		    169.254.0.0 - 255.255.0.0 eth0
		    default 10.3.0.1 - -
	- modify ibobservercontrol and check_los to refer to atadb instead of
	auxcntl
	- DNSserver - Need a DNS server that is (exclusively) for the control
	machines to minimize extraneous lookups from non-control hosts (e.g.,
	dhcp-based machines). Copied the /var/named root from auxcntl.
	- DNS: redefine ns4 to atadb
	- DNS: redefine obscntl to atadb
	- DNS: redefine ntp2-2 to atadb (from auxcntl)	    and then
	- NTPstart ntp server on atadb 
	- CRONTAB: move auxcntl obs crons to atadb

      	- modify the /etc/group to add the atasys user to the uucp group so
	that the ADRserver (the GPIB i/f to the rack pam) will start up
	  	 uucp:x:14:atasys



MAINCNTL/USER2
	- DataServer
	  - move DataServer to user2 (edit processes.xml and copy the 
	  DataServerInit file into the user2 setup dir.
	  -copy the /opt/atasys/data from maincntl to user2
	  - MYSQL
		user2 version is 5.0.45
		- enable mysql via yast services (start the database)
		- init mysql server
	    	  	 # mysql_secure_installation
		  	 (use 115 for root password)
			 remove anonymous users (Y)
			 disallow root login remotely (Y)
			 remove test database (Y)
		- create user
		  	 # mysql -p -u root
			 create user atauser@localhost identified by
			 'atapswd';
		- initialize the data directory
			 # mysql_install_db --user=atauser \
			   --basedir=/opt/atasys \
			 grant all on atauser.* to atauser@localhost;
	- JSDA move the other jsda processes to user2 (edit processes.xml)
	  -Change the user2 queue server entry to reflect that it is the
	parent. Also need to use set/common/QueueIncgcServer (Instead of QueueServer)
	processes.xml	       
	  - edit all host processes.xml QueueServer defs to use user2 as parent
	- MIRIAD: The DNS name Linux-x86_64 pointed to canonical name of auxcntl
	(10.3.0.72). The miriad share was on the auxcntl /export/miriad and
	the ldap would use $OSNAME-$CPU:/export/miriad for this mount 
	(Linux-x86_64 - which is the case for all machine now --- we no longer 
	have SunOS-i86pc--pointed to strato nor Linux-i386--pointed to weather
	 machine variants). Furthermore, the /export/miriad was actually a
	 link (on auxcntl) into /export/auxcntl/miriad (actual location). 
         Change that DNS name to point to user2 (although no longer needed as
	 we are eliminating the architecture-specific roots. 
	 Copy the miriad root (auxcntl:/export/miriad) to
	 user2:/exports/user2/miriad
	 and create a link in user2:/exports/miriad to /exports/user2/miriad.
	 - CRONTAB: setup (former maincntl) crontab jobs on user2

ANTCNTL/CONTROL
   Preparation
	- /etc - config done during control commissioning
	       ldap, ntp, resolv, fstab, exports,services, sshd
	       /etc/sysconfig/network
	- User accounts (under LDAP control)
	       atasys (/opt/atasys)
	       ataant (/opt/ataant)
	       (requires that the pam_ldap module be installed. Remove
	       client start of tls from ldap.conf ???)
	- dhcpd for antennas (for subnet 172.20.0.0)
	  	/etc/dhcpd.conf
	  	/etc/dhcpd.ataant.conf
		/etc/dhcpd.switches.conf

		logging ??? in journalctl???
		-NB - service will not start until interface ready (do at switchover)
	- pxe boot server
	  requires a tftp (loaded atftp) service be started. 
	  On old antcntl
	     vsftpd                    0:off  1:off  2:off  3:off  4:off  5:off  6:off
          	tftp:               on
        	vsftpd:             off
	  On new antcntl (opensuse Leap)
	      atftpd service (a static service, runs on socket activation)
	      /etc/sysconfig/atftpd
		  DIRECTORY /opt/ataant/boot
 	      systemctl enable atftpd.socket
	      systemctl start atftpd.socket 
	      systemctl status atftpd.{socket,service} 
	- rsyncd 
	  /etc/rsyncd  --- need the deamon running w/ "ataant" module
	- recoveryServer uses the dataserver to access its database
	  so nothing to do.
	- JSDA
	    NOPASSWD for processserver execution
	      the jsda script does an ssh to host to do stop/start/status.
	      requires the following in sudo file,.e., as root, visudo)
	      atasys ALL= NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d/processserver
	    $ATA_HOME/ata/etc/hosts-jsda
		add control
	    $ATA_HOME/ata/setup/control  
	    	processes.xml (remove historical processes)
		recoveryserver-config.xml
	    /etc/init.d/processserver
		QueueServer
			NB: the old sunfire queue server startup used the
			common QueuParaGCServerJVM6 (Parallel Garbage Collection)


			> more QueueParaGCServerJVM6
			  #!/usr/bin/env bash
			  export ATA_JAVA_HOME=/hcro/opt/jdk1.6.0_24
			  export ATA_LOG4J_CONF=/hcro/atasys/ata/setup/common/log4j/colby-debug-stdout.xml
			  export ATA_LOG4J_LEVEL=TRACE1
			  . `dirname $0`/ata.startup.sh

			  exec java -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -server
			  -XX:+UseParallelGC -Xmx600m ${JAVA_XTRA}
			  ata.jsda.QueueServer "${ATA_SERVICE+--ata-service-}${ATA_SERVICE}" "$@" 2>&1 1>> ${ATA_TOP_LOG:-.}/`basename $0`.log

			> more QueueServer

			  exec java ata.jsda.QueueServer "${ATA_SERVICE+--ata-service-}${ATA_SERVICE}" "$@" 2>&1 >> ${ATA_TOP_LOG:-.}/`ba
sename $0`.log
			WANT to continue to use the original queueserver
			startup - it reduces the thread count of queueserver
			from 208 to 104 through garbage collection
		
		AntennaServer
			started w/ -Xms100m -Xmx800m
		RecoveryServer
			2017-11-28 - could not run AntennaServer and
			RecoveryServer using the old java install on the new
			OS. Kept getting memory depletion. 
		- all others are obsolete or OBE
	- "antcntl" dependencies. Some scripts (wrappotstatus)
	refer to antcntl directly. These will need to be modified
	- OS configuration - encountered memory depletion errors during thread
	creation. Needed to increase the max users processes (thereby
		increasing memory

   Switchover
	- reboot ants
	- shutdown antcntl jsda processes. Remove antcntl from network (and hosts-jsda). 
	- switch ant subnet eth cable over to control. Start dhcpd on control
		(it will fail if cable is not plugged in)
	- start control jsda processes (/etc/init.d/processserver start)
