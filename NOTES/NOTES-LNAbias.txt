	  2017-07-17 - update location of config files. add reference to
	  python libraries (end of this file)

LNA SET/GET commands
	(from obs - see command help for more options)
	atagetlnas <ant>
	atasetlnas <ant>

LNA Bias adjust (Manual)
    >ssh ataant@antcntl
    > ssh <ant>
    > netcat pax 23
      

  commands are:
  	   getid [x|y]
	   [get|set]vm [x|y]
	   [get|set]vd [x|y]
	   [get|set]vg [x|y]

  LNA Bias settings are based on the Feed that the Pax is installed in.
  For any given Feed there should be a Feed Info Sheet supplied by the
  factory (Minex).

  Historically, these feed reports are stored in the log under
  Engineering/Feed Swap Database)

  Feeds have been repaired many times, old Feed Info Sheets should be 
  deleted or stored separately from current Feed Info Sheets.
  The feed report delivered with the feed provides the optimium LNA settings

vg - gain voltage
vd - drain voltage
vm - mean voltage
id - power output

Basic Rules (4/10/15):
  1st rule  When you enter a value you will always get a different value, 
  so you should anticipate this by starting with an ajusted value. (example 
  -1.0 gets you -.97).

  2nd rule  Always start with Vm, then adjust Vd, last adjust Vg, you will 
  need to play with Vd & Vg a little to hit your target Id.

  3rd rule  All Fraunhofer LNAs (r at end of SN) must have Vm set at -.80 
  and Vd set at 1.50, only Vg is adjusted to get Id at or around 60.0.

  4th rule  All Northrop-Grumman LNAs have Vm set at just below -1.0, some 
  older LNAs will still be using Vm setting lower that than -1.0 (example 
  -1.20).

  5th rule  If you can.t get Vm, Vd, Vg + Id to adjust, then something is 
  wrong with the LNA.

  6th rule  If you are adjusting Vd & Vg with values that are way off from 
  the Report and getting Id values close to the Report values something is 
  wrong.

  7th rule If something is wrong/not working wright check LNA/Dewar temp, 
  if temp is above 70-75K LNA biasing changes drastically.

Basic Rules (pre 4/15):
1. LNAs  have an # designating vendor type, revision. Vendors are Northrup-G 
  (older, ABB-XXX) and Fraunhofer (newer, ABB-XXXr).

2. The ABB-XXXb is an old LNA # from the first Feeds built (2006). These are Northrop-G LNA.s. 
  There may not be any of these left. The Vm -.96 & -.97 give them away.

3. "Northrop-G.s you can play with (adjust values) more than Fraunhofer.s" (???).
  "On Northrup-G LNAs for Vm just type in -1 and go with what you get."

4. If the LNA # has the r at its end, you need to set Vm to -.80, Vd to 1.50 & 
  then adjust Vg until Id is around the 60.00 value.

5. If the LNA # doesn.t have the r at its end, the new standard(2009>) is set Vm 
  at -.98, adjust Vg & Vd as needed to get to the Id value

6. We are trying to keep Id lower/less heat).

7. You shouldn't have to go beyond the reports Vd & Vg settings (+/-.05)

8. "If things are not adjusting correctly something is wrong, double check what you.re doing, back track, in the end the lna could be damaged."

9. "Only extreme Vm (-1.2+) and Vd (2.0+) settings could over drive an LNA, 
  it would start oscillating first & performance would drop noticeably, then 
  at some point it may get damaged."

10. "Probing the tip circuit board at the end of the arms, with a Multi-meter, 
  out on an antenna will toast an LNA !"


Adjusting Values:

-The goal is to hit the numbers provided in the feed sheet (taking into account
   general rules above). i.e., first adjust Vm, then set Vd, then set Vg a little.
   Vd & Vg include each other, jump back and forth between them until Id is close.
   Vg + Vd  to feed sheet values should 
  get you roughly the feed sheet Id value.
- May have to tweak Vg + Vd a little to get there.

CONFIG FILES:
Feed config report data (feed-config) and feed location (feed-location) is in $ATA_HOME/ata/etc. Currently
stored in xml format. NOTE - this may change in future. Use low-level APIs for
access instead of direct access to file.
