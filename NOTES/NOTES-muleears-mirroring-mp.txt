Notes on performing Synology-to-Synology backup mirroring and initial config

History:
  2015-03-10: Created by TLK
  2015-07-01: elk - See end of NOTES for latest on automated rsync methods
  2016-06-07: elk - changes to MP VPN and ata-mp-mirror IP after location move

Initial configuration (first time only)
---------------------------------------

On ata-mp-mirror:
  - Backup&Replication -> Shared Folder Sync -> Server (tab) -> Check "Enabled
  Shared Folder Sync Service"

On user2:
   - open VPN connection
     - snx -s vpn.sri.com -u e20977  (use your id/password)
     - Setup port forwarding on user2 to send mulears:1234 to ata-mp-mirror:22
       ssh -N -L 10.3.0.57:1234:ata-mp-mirror.esg.sri.com:22 localhost
     - Test connection by ssh'ing to ata-mp-mirror
       On tumulus: ssh Admin@user2.hcro.org -p 1234

On muleears:
   - Backup&Replication -> Shared Folder Sync -> Client (tab) -> Create:
     - Task Name: ata-mp-mirror
     - Source to sync: check "exports"
       - Check "I understand...."
     - servername: user2.hcro.org
     - username: Admin
     - password: password for ata-mp-mirror
     - Check "Customize SSH encryption port for encrypted shared folder sync
       - Port: 1234
     - Check "Enable SSH transfer encryption"
     - Check "Enable block level synchronization"
     - Click "Test Connection" to make sure everything is correct.
     - Set schedule: Run sync manually

     - No speed control for this side of the sync
       Need to set it up on ata-mp-mirror probably

On user2:
     - After successfully adding the sync task:
       - kill the ssh forwarding on user2
       - close the vpn: snx -d

To do a backup
---------------

On user2:
   - open VPN connection
     - snx -s vpn.sri.com -u e20977  (use your id/password)
     - Setup port forwarding on user2 to send mulears:1234 to ata-mp-mirror:22
       ssh -N -L 10.3.0.57:1234:ata-mp-mirror.esg.sri.com:22 localhost
     - Test connection by ssh'ing to ata-mp-mirror
       On tumulus: ssh Admin@user2.hcro.org -p 1234

On Muleears:
   - Backup&Replication -> Shared Folder Sync -> Client (tab)
     - Click "Sync Now"

When done, close up shop on user2:
       - kill the ssh forwarding on user2
       - close the vpn: snx -d

----------------------------------------------------

Alternative method (13 May)

- mirror-rsync account on blake7 (for tunneling access from ata-mp-mirror)
- create rsync user on ata-mp-mirror (with a home directory/volume1/homes/rsync/.ssh in which to store
  private key). Public key installed on blake7
- From Synology DSM Help

  "Note:

    - If other people want to perform network backup from a client that is not
    Synology NAS, they can only do so with the privileges of admin or rsync on 
    your Synology NAS. If you don't want to share your admin credentials with 
    other people, you can go to Control Panel > User to create a user named
    rsync, modify its privileges, and then share its user credentials with
    other people.
    - If you perform network backup from a Synology NAS running a version of
    DSM before 3.0 or a client that is not Synology NAS, and you want to
    retain the source data's owner and group information, you must add the
    backup account to the administrators group, and back up data to the
    NetBackup shared folder."

    It seems that the Synology DSM backup services are for configuring push
    type of backups. Because a push to MP mirror would require a VPN running
    on muleears (not an option)

----------------------------------------------------------
Method of automated rsync from ata-mp-mirror cron job via a tunnel

1. Per above, the following accounts exist for these scripts:
   mirror-rsync account on blake7. Public key installed
   rsync user on ata-mp-mirror /volume1/homes/rsync. Private key in .ssh dir

2. Scripts (rsync@ata-mp-mirror:bin) - owned/run by root
   - script to maintain tunnel thru blake7 to muleears: ~rsync/bin/tunnelkeepalive
   - script to ensure tunnel remains alive: ~rsync/bin/tunnelwatchdog.sh 
   - script to rsync obs data: ~rsync/bin/runrsync-obsdata
     	 - in crontab for 18:00 every day. Exits on failure to get semaphore
	 (means prior job is still running)
  	 - NB - this script is currently set to rsync only lwye data (on
	 muleears and excluding arrayhealth)
	 - CHANGE this script if want to do other obs data roots or more
	 excludes
	 - log file is in ~rsync/log
   - script to rsync other data: ~rsync/bin/runrsync-other
     	 - in crontab for every 2,5 day of the week at 06:00 (perhaps overkill?)
     	 - set to rsync the svn/ata rdiff backup on muleears (originally
	 rsynced from basalt to muleears).
	 - CHANGE this script if you want to do other non-obs roots	 

3. Testing
   - testing remotely problematic as it requires VPN to be running which times
   out after 8 hours even though running script detached.
   - would modify crontab to set the hour to short delta, but couldn't figure
   out how to get crontab to be reloaded....work-around was to reboot. clumsy.


ACCESS 2016-06-07
---------------------------
VPN access to SRI is now via vpn-mp.sri.com --- and it does not support linux
snx clients. It does support setup via web interface, but requires latest in 
java package.

Also, ata-mp-mirror IP is now 128.18.144.86 (as of 6/7/16 the DNS had not been updated)
