NOTES: D2D (foxtrot beamformer raw data)
DATE: 2018-01-17
      2018-11-05 use ft:elin/ft_all_new.bash for host list as argument
      2019-05-01 - timing sync issue (ntp?). Also, add description of startup

STARTUP
----------------------
Config:
~obs/bbarott/foxsrv/FoxHookup.cfg
	- what is the mapping of antpols to ft nodes?

Entities:
[script location: /home/obs/bbarott/foxsrv]
[see shared mount: boot2:/b2s/b* and /b2s/bfu/data]

  Node	Script			Class Instantiation
  ft	fxs_managerserver.rb  	fxs_manager
  ft* 	fxs_nodeserver.rb	fxs_node
  tumulus foxcap_init.rb	fxs_recsrvr - invokes fxs_node.recordStart
  tumulus foxcap_rec.rb		invokes fxc_recsrvr.recordStart

recordStart (running on the ft*) invokes packet relay to write to file in {datadir}:
        pkdir = "/hcro/foxsys/OpenSonATA/sigproc-pkg/utilities/packetrelay/src"
        datadir = "/data"
        cmd = "#{pkdir}/packetrelay -I 226.0.0.1 -i #{port} -f #{datadir}/#{fn} -s #{pklen}"

WHERE is TIMESTAMP in this data file? First row processed generates "spam"
output in a log somewhere

UTILITES on FT:
--------------------------------------
ft_all:
This script taks a host list and distributes a specified command. The commands
can be generic linux commands or a specialized command.

See ~/elin/ft_all_new.bash <host list> {serial|parallel|local} cmd

See ~/ft_all.bash    --- contains host list and code to distribute the remote
    		     command (through distribution of ft_all_cmd.bash) 
		     and run in parallel or serially. 

Commands: (taken from ~/elin/ft_all_20120818/NOTES)

# shtudown nodes
./ft_all.bash serial "run /sbin/shutdown -h -P now"


#generate and copy key on ft node 
./ft_all.bash serial "keygen"
./ft_all.bash local "keycopy"

# See how much space is available on each node
./ft_all.bash serial "run df -h| grep /data"

# Delete a set of data.  Be very carful with this!
# Check first with ls
# ./ft_all.bash serial "run ls /data/20111215-*" | more
# ./ft_all.bash serial "run rm /data/20111215-*"

#copy files based on a date
# e.g., get a list of all files that have been modified in past 6 days, use that for rsync
# have to make sure the destination is mounted
./ft_all.bash serial "run find /data -type f -mtime -7 -printf '%f\n'> /tmp/files.txt | rsync -av --files-from=/tmp/files.txt /data foxtrot-boot1:/mnt/sdd"


============================================================================
Copying a collection of data to thumb drives
============================================================================
# For the list of collection nodes:
#    insert usb drive into the right hand port on the back of each ft node
#    make a record (spreadsheet/ paper) of which thumb drive # is where
#
# Edit ft_all.bash.  Change the list of nodes at the top to what was used
# in the collect

# Delete all the per node log files
./ft_all.bash serial "run rm /tmp/ft_all_cmd.log ; touch /tmp/ft_all_cmd.log"
# Look in the log files for errors is something goes wrong.

# Check the all nodes find a correct thumb drve
./ft_all.bash serial "find_usb"
# Look for any no drive found messages, and fix problems

# Format the thumb drives (takes 5-10 minutes)
./ft_all.bash parallel "format_usb"

# Wait for the jobs to finish
./ft_all.bash serial "run ps aux | grep mkfs | grep -v grep"
# You will see no more mkfs lines when donw

# Check the output
./ft_all.bash serial "run cat /tmp/ft_all_cmd.log; echo" | more
# look for any issues

# mount the drives
./ft_all.bash parallel "mount_usb"

# check that they are mounted and see how much space is available
./ft_all.bash serial "run df -h | grep ata_thumb"

# Come up with the correct ls args to describe the data
./ft_all.bash serial "run ls /data/20120816_* " | more

# Check the pre compression data size
./ft_all.bash serial "run du -sch /data/20120816_* | tail -1"
# The data should compress or less then 60% of this in the transfer.
# Sometimes less that 50%

# Transfer the data
./ft_all.bash parallel "transfer /data/20120816_*"

# Wait for transfer to finish
./ft_all.bash serial "run ps aux | grep \"time gzip\" | grep -v grep"
# This is a little flakey.  For some reason there are occasional long
# pauses with no apparent usb activity on some nodes.  The lights on
# the usb drives still blink.  Waiting upto 20 minutes for activity to 
# resume.

# The last file written is
./ft_all.bash serial "run ls -lhrt /tmp/ata_thumb/ | tail -1"

# Look for 100% used drives.  This indicates that an attempt was made to
# transfer too much data.
./ft_all.bash serial "run df -h | grep ata_thumb"

# To generate a record of what is on the drives
./ft_all.bash serial "run ls -lh /tmp/ata_thumb/" > 20120818_all_thumb.txt


# If all the data is transfered, unmount the drives
./ft_all.bash parallel "unmount_usb"

# check that they are unmounted
./ft_all.bash serial "run df -h | grep ata_thumb"

ISSUE of rsync failures due to host key verification failure - -- host did not have ssh keys
defined and those keys were not in the authorized_keys file on foxtrot-boot1.
[NB: I just created ft11 key as test, hence current date]

------------
ISSUE of ntp synchronization - because ft nodes are off for long periods,
their ntp servers (primary is ft from which other nodes get their time) do not
sync (the jitter and offset keeps increasing).

1. while has current CNS2 server in ntp.conf, has ntp1-2 (==ntp1-6 ===
meinberg 005) as "prefered"
	 - change the cns2 as the prefered. Remove reference to ntp1-2
	 - If we ever do protected and use the meinbergs, will need to modify
	 back.

2. Add to /etc/sysconfig/ntp
   NTPD_FORCE_SYNC_ON_STARTUP="yes" 
   NTPD_FORCE_SYNC_HWCLOCK_ON_STARTUP="yes"
