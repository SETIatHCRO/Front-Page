Apache2:
  Version:       # apache2ctl -v
                 Server version: Apache/2.4.6 (Linux/SUSE)
                 Server built:   2014-10-13 13:15:28.000000000 +0000
  Documentation: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/
                 http://en.opensuse.org/Apache2 (very sparse)
                 http://en.opensuse.org/Apache_Quickstart_HOWTO (docs only thru 11.4)
                 /usr/share/doc/packages/apache2/README.SUSE
  Config Files:  
    openSUSE and SLES (Apache httpd 2.2):

    ServerRoot              ::      /srv/www
    DocumentRoot            ::      /srv/www/htdocs
    Apache Config File      ::      /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
    Listen port bind        ::      /etc/apache2/listen.conf
    Other Config Files      ::      /etc/sysconfig/apache2
    SSL Config File         ::      /etc/apache2/ssl-global.conf
    ErrorLog                ::      /var/log/apache2/error_log
    AccessLog               ::      /var/log/apache2/access_log

    start/stop              ::      /etc/init.d/apache2 (start|restart|restart-graceful|reload|graceful|graceful-stop|stop|configtest)

     Notes:     Modules are enabled in /etc/sysconfig/apache2 which 
     is read by the startup script. 
     The a2enmod/a2dismod tool can be used to activate/deactivate modules.


  Runs as User wwwrun Group www
  Name-based Virtual Hosting
    - add NameVirtualHost directive in listen.conf
      NameVirtualHost *:80

    - add the server name to DNS, e.g., arsls.hcro.org, pointing to server IP

  Name-based Virtual Hosts
    - add a /etc/apache2/vhosts.d/<vhostname>.conf
        <VirtualHost 74.43.140.32:80>
            ServerAdmin www@hcro.org
            ServerName arsls.hcro.org
            DocumentRoot /srv/www/vhosts/arsls  (non drupal version)

            CustomLog /var/log/apache2/arsls-access_log combined
            ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/arsls-error_log
          ...
          </VirtualHost>

     - use symbolic link to put server files on different partition???
          e.g., /srv/www/vhosts/arsls is a symbolic link to different partition
          So had to add a directive in main server to allow symbolic links
          for the /srv/www/vhosts directory, e.g.,
            -created file /srv/www/vhosts/vhosts-sym.conf
                  <Directory "/srv/www/vhosts">
                    Options +FollowSymLinks
                  </Directory>
     -added include line into /etc/sysconfig/apache2
                APACHE_CONF_INCLUDE_FILES="/srv/www/vhosts/vhosts-sym.conf"
              # This allows you to add e.g. VirtualHost statements without 
              # touching /etc/apache2/httpd.conf itself, which makes upgrading 
              # easier. When the server starts, it will create an entry in
              # the /etc/apache2/sysconfig.d/include.conf w/ that include
         
     - modify controls on who can get from the server. This is done in the 
     directory section of the vhost conf file (e.g., arsls.conf)
        Require all granted     
  
Subversion:
    - Install
    - HTTP configuration (access via apache web server)
      - Config files
      	/etc/apache2/conf.d/subversion.conf  --- add the repository info
	/etc/apache2/vhosts.d/svn.conf    -- to redirect the repositories as
	virtual host roots
MySQL:
    - run mysql setup after install to set up root account, etc.
      # /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation  
    - create the pydio user and database in mysql
      drop user pydio@localhost;                  - may not be needed, but
      flush privileges;                           - cleared up some issues
      create user pydio@localhost identified by 'pydios_password'
      grant all on pydio.* to pydio@localhost with grant option

      

Pydio:
version 6.0.2
  Default installed php:
    # php --version
    PHP 5.4.20 (cli)
    Copyright (c) 1997-2013 The PHP Group
    Zend Engine v2.4.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2013 Zend Technologies

  Initial Run: 
   - missing php extension modules
      PHP Fatal error:  Class 'DOMDocument' not found
      -install php5-dom
      PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined function json_encode()
      -install php5-json

  Pydio Diagnostic Tool:
    -Security Breach - "data/ folder is not correctly protected...subfolders
      are web-accessible"
        - added Directory directive to remove indexes and followsymlinks options
        but that didn't solve the error
        - commented out data directory directive to followSymLinks. This
        seemed to solve the data directive error.
    -Exif Extension enabled (warning) "installing php-exif extension is
    recommended if you plan to handle images" ignored
    -PHP Output Buffer disabled - "should disable php output_buffering for
      better performance"
        Apache has directives (in apache config) that allow changing of PHP 
        directives, but ignored
    -SSL Encryption - "You are not using SSL encryption or it was not detected."
        not using SSL" ignore for now -- later setup up for SSL.

  Pydio Install:
    - Configure for mysql usage. Examine the logs if failure to connect to database
    - configure admin account


Pydio 6.0.7  (5/15/15)
    - get tar version from sourceForge. Put into /opt/pydio-core-6.0.7 (w/
    link /opt/pydio)
    - chown -R wwwrun /srv/www/pydio/pydio-core-6.0.7/data/
    - modify /etc/apache2/arsls.conf  (server for arsls project)
      - add alias for /pydio to point to /opt/pydio
      - add Directory entry for /opt/pydio
      	- need to specify AllowOverride All to get past "Security Breach on
	data/ folder"
      - add Directory entry for /opt w/ FollowSymLinks

      - got warning from setup wizard regarding "cannot write htaccess
        file". Fix was to copy text they provided into the
        /opt/pydio-core-6.0.7/.htaccess
      - could not log in w/ admin account, but had also created elin account.
      - Also had old accounts from prior 6.0.4 install - logged in
      	> mysql -u root -p
	use pydio

      SSHD configuration
# ssh -V
OpenSSH_6.2p2, OpenSSL 1.0.1i 6 Aug 2014

  sshd_config -- new settings
    AuthenticationMethods publickey
    PermitRootLogin no

    settings based on blake:
    Protocol 2
    AddressFamily inet      #to make sure that X-11 forwarding works in non-IPv6 environment
    X11Forwarding yes
    X11DisplayOffset 10
    ClientAliveInterval 300
    ClientAliveCountMax 5
    PermitTunnel  yes
    AuthorizedKeysFile  .ssh/authorized_keys

    NB: may want to consider using the from="pattern-list" method
    of setting allowed hosts. The pattern can be the canonical name
    of a remote host, and IP address, or CIDR notation. Wilcards 
    allowed, e.g.,
      128.18.0.0/24 - SRI
      209.119.0.0/24 - SETI
    The problem would be users come from home and mobile locations...

  Restart SSHD
    kill -HUP `cat /var/run/sshd.pid`
    /usr/sbin/sshd

USER ADMIN:
  useradd -m -s /bin/bash <user>
  install the users public key on their authorized_keys file. Ensure file
  has 644 access only. Password login is no longer used 
  NOTE - login was being rejected because said account was locked. So solution
  was to set a password on the account (that is never exercised as long as key works)
 

  Priv account - add user to wheel group
    usermod -G wheel <user>

PUBLIC KEY AUTHENTICATION
  See SOP instructing users on key pair generation
  Copy users public key to their home .ssh/authorized_keys file
  MAKE sure the owner on this file is properly set (to user)

FIREWALL - added to the rules to allow ssh
	 ACCEPT all dmz:BLAKE7 tcp ssh
NOTE!!! - this probably is not a good idea as opens potential path into other
	 hcro machines. Maybe see if there are rules to limit movement from
	 thistle to hcro...
