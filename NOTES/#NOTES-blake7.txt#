DATE: 3 Dec 2014
History:
12/3/14 ELK Created
1/7/15 Added DNS swap notes
2/24/15 Added DNS external zone updates notes

Creation of new ATA bastion host.

OpenBSD blake7.hcro.org 5.6 GENERIC.MP#299 i386 Rackable Systems (Tyan Computer)
 
FIREWALL:
- add blake7 to shorewall ruleset per blake config
- TODO - revisit the tunnel for nagios when reinstalling nagios
- modify the /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf to reference blake7 as domain name server (note
    this would satisfy any configs that get this info from the dhcpd

DNS:
- add blake7 to master hcro.org (currently maintained on blake)

OpenBSD 5.6 INSTALL:
  74.43.140.35
  255.255.255.192
  em0
  route default 74.43.140.1
  ntp1.berkeley.edu
  ns - use blake (temporaty) and mrpink

  packages - (take defaults but remove game56)
    bsd - This is the Kernel. Required
    bsd.mp - Multi-processor (SMP) kernel (only some platforms)
    bsd.rd - RAM disk kernel
    base56.tgz - Contains the base OpenBSD system Required
    etc56.tgz - Contains all the files in /etc Required
    comp56.tgz - Contains the compiler and its tools, headers and libraries.
    man56.tgz - Contains man pages
  - game56.tgz - Contains the games for OpenBSD
    xbase56.tgz - Contains the base libraries and utilities for X11
    xetc56.tgz - Contains the /etc/X11 and /etc/fonts configuration files
    xfont56.tgz - Contains X11's font server and fonts
    xserv56.tgz - Contains X11's X servers
    xshare56.tgz - Contains manpages, locale settings, includes, etc. for X

    add bash and tcsh shell packages
      pkg_add -c ftp://ftp5.usa.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/5.6/pacakages/i386/bash-4.3.18.tgz

  Disk Partition - use defaults (320G drive total). user dirs in /home
    blake has a /data area, but did not set that up on blake7

  rc.conf.local - boot processes
    - enable the following
      sshd, sendmail, nfs?, named,ntpd,syslogd

      SSHD configuration
# ssh -V
OpenSSH_6.7, LibreSSL 2.0

  sshd_config -- new settings
    AuthenticationMethods publickey
    PermitRootLogin no

    settings based on blake:
    Protocol 2
    X11Forwarding yes
    X11DisplayOffset 10
    ClientAliveInterval 300
    ClientAliveCountMax 5
    PermitTunnel  yes
    AuthorizedKeysFile  .ssh/authorized_keys

    NB: may want to consider using the from="pattern-list" method
    of setting allowed hosts. The pattern can be the canonical name
    of a remote host, and IP address, or CIDR notation. Wilcards 
    allowed, e.g.,
      128.18.0.0/24 - SRI
      209.119.0.0/24 - SETI
    The problem would be users come from home and mobile locations...

  Restart SSHD
    kill -HUP `cat /var/run/sshd.pid`
    /usr/sbin/sshd

USER ADMIN:
  useradd -m -s /usr/local/bin/<bash | tcsh> <user>
  install the users public key on their authorized_keys file. Password
  login is no longer used 

  Priv account - add user to wheel group
    user mod -G wheel <user>

PUBLIC KEY AUTHENTICATION
  See SOP instructing users on key pair generation
  Copy users public key to their home .ssh/authorized_keys file
  MAKE sure the owner on this file is properly set (to user)

DNS PRIMARY MASTER MIGRATION
  /var/named/etc/named.conf
  /var/named/master/*

  On Blake7
  copy over config files from blake
    /var/named/etc/named.conf
    /var/named/master/*

  modify the master hcro.org 
    assign blake7 in SOA and to ns1
    modify ns1 to be blake7
    keep blake as an NS ?
  modify named.conf to include blake7 ip to hcro.org zone (remove blake?)
  modify the reverse maps to use blake7 in SOA
    TBD - visit method to generate reverse maps from master file!!
  modify /etc/resolv.conf:
    - add search hcro.org (first line), and blake7 address

  On other NS (auxcntl, basalt, mrpink)
  modify their /etc/named.conf in all references to master IP address
  modify /etc/resolv.conf to reference blake7 ip address

  On firewall
    see steps at top of notes
  Other machines
  Biz machines - modify their configs to reference blake7 as preferred DNS server
  Obs machines - no mods necessary as they reference slave dns servers only

  Actual changeover steps.
  1. start blake7 named
  2. shutdown blake named
  3. force the update of the slaves (deletes and rebuilds their cache)

  2/24/15 
  (1)INFORM NS1.SRI.COM, which serves as a primary NS for hcro.org that
  the hcro primary ns (blake7) address has changed... w/o doing this the
  expiry date would have passed (~41 days) after shut down of blake and
  ns1.sri.com would stop asking for updates and stop serving up the records.
  (2) remove the shrewdraven zones from the blake7 /var/named/etc/named.conf
  (3) add mrpink back into the allowed list for transfers (correct typo) 

SCP - obs node/account to user-specific blake7 account
  Problem: Users copy obs-owned files to their blake7 account for ultimate 
  transfer outside, but default blake7 authentication is by public key.

  Options: 
  1) add obs public key to users authorized keys
    This would allow any obs user into the users blake7 account
  2) use host-based authentication from 10.3.0.0/24 to blake7
    This too would allow any obs user into the users blake7 account
  3) Add additional password authentication method for 10.3.0.0/24 source hots
      Add following at the end of the blake7:/etc/ssh/sshd_config

      Match Address 10.3.0.0/24
        AuthenticationMethods password

      For hosts that match the address, address will try the additional
      password-based authentication method (since the public key method
      will fail.

  Using option 1 followed by option 3. Any user wanting to transfer (push) from the obs
  account to their blake7 account would first look for the obs public key in their
  blake7 authorized_keys file. NOTE the obs account private key is not
  pass-phrase protected, so such a transfer can occur w/o prompting, which is
  required for automated scripting. Failing presence of the obs public key in the
  users authorized_keys, the user would be prompted for their blake7 account password...
  which typically most have not set up (since they are using keys to login from the
  outside), so there will be confusion
