NOTES: FXA/FXC failure modes and fixing solutions

AUTHOR:  ELK, TK,KK, LW

--------------------------------------------------------------
Scenarios:

A. F-board SBC bootup failure
  Evident from red indicators on front of SBC card. Connect the console terminal 
  to the VGA output and it will indicate where hanging. Can also confirm by pinging,
  e.g., ping f1.fxa  or fxhealth (pings all correlator sbcs)

  1) A reset of the board should clear the problem (small pushbutton on front of card). 
    Failing that,
  2) a power cycle of the f-board chassis (and do x-board at same time for surity)
  3) may also need to reseat the SBC. 
  

B. C-board load hanging during fcxinit call within set-defaults
  This is caused by an incomplete connection between the C-board and I-board and/or cPCI.

  1) Determine the offending C-board (see schematic below) and gently nudge/push against
  it's connection at the back of the I-board. If successful, you will see the glow of the
  C-board red indicator light as it comes on. The fcxinit will also move forward with its
  initialization of other cards.
  2) If nudging (try harder and again) doesn't succeed, then may have to reseat the C-board.  See instructions for this below.
  
C. F-board initialization failed
  set-defaults doesn't hang, but some of the symptoms here are:
    - set-defaults fcxinit step that synchronized the X-boards will give message 
    that says "Set..." rather than "Synchronized..."
    - an fcheck of the f-board temperatures after they are loaded will have non-nominal
    temperations e.g. <60 or >95. Note that the latter could be legitimate and just
    a hot fpga (a different use case), but the former (a cold fpga) is an indicator 
    that the fpga did not initialize

    Easiest way to confirm whether an FPGA initialized is:
      f1.fxa> fbuptime.rb
      0: up 0d 00:31:13.63
      1: up 127d 00:31:22.63
      2: up 0d 00:00:00.00
      3: up 0d 00:31:38.63

    A time of all zeroes indicates failure as does a large time value (we just
    rebooted for heavens sake).

    Possible actions
    1) Nudge the I-board connection for the related C-board
    2) May have to reseat the entire I-board
    3) May have to reseat the C-board

D. X-board SBC bootup failure
  Indicator lights on X-board SBC are red or unit does not ping (fxhealth will ping
  all of the correlator boards). Connect console terminal to VGA output to see
  where hanging

    1)Reset the SBC (small reset pushbutton on front)
    2)May possibly need to power-cycle (cycle f-boards for surity)
    3)May need to reseat SBC card

E. Block Artifacts in Scan

F. Channels Missing

G.

H. Reseating the I(nterconnect)-board (F-Chassis)
  The I-board has a template insert that should first be pushed up and the board and 
  template pushed directly onto the c-boards. A bowed i-board indicates failure to reseat.
  Harder to see would be failure to reseat from top to bottom. Board should push solidly
  on and have no give anywhere.

I. Xboard missing.
   - This will first be seen in the set-defaults in xboard loads where there
   is no "Loading X board 3" after the "Initializing fx64{a|c}:J{1|7}",
   instead it just moved on to Intializing fx64..:J{3|9}
   - What that indicates is that an xboard is not being seen. Could be any of
   the 4 xboards. The PCI just maps whatever it sees in the chassis in order.
   - the slots are in bus2, left to right addressing, 0a-0f (e.g., the board next to
   the SBC is 0f)
   - a pcitweak -l or scanpci will list the bus 02 cards and give the device
   number. If  physical card is not showing up in this list of bus 2 cards,
   then that is the problem card.

J. Channel block Extreme Amp. variation - across set of channels for xboard
   -a single value can throw off the range of amplitude plotting. Need to
   narrow down to the offending channel(s). With that, could be the ribbon
   cables or the matching C boards or interconnect board...

GENERAL TOOLS
---------------------------------------
1. Memory test tools
  xmemtest
2. Spectrum graph
  fxspec.rb
Usage:

  fxspec.rb [OPTIONS] INST IN0 IN1 [CHANNEL_START [CHANNEL_COUNT [DUMPS]]]

Options:

  -b                  Output binary data
  -d PGPLOT_DEV       Plot spectrum to PGPLOT_DEV rather than printing them
  -f                  Mask channel 512
  -m                  Flip (mirror) the spectrum
  -n                  Normalize values by dividing by total number of samples
  -r                  Compute RMS as square root of normalized values
  -w                  Wait for banks to swap before dumping
  -p                  Report peak power and channel

Defaults:

  CHANNEL_START = 0 for fx8 and fx16; 0 or 512 (host-specific) for fx32 and fx64
  CHANNEL_COUNT = 1024 for fx8 and fx16; 512 for fx32 and fx64
  DUMPS = 1

3. PCI tools
   scanpci
   pcitweak -l
