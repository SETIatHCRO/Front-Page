NOTES:  Bee2 configuration,etc
DATE:   03/24/15


Commissioning:
  BEE has to be configured with the proper network settings for 
  it to work with the system.

  On the front of the BEE2 there is a slot for a small flash card. 
  There are 2 types of cards. One labeled "Borph Linux July 2007" 
  and "4-25-07 Test Suite v1.1". The former is for operation, the
  latter for testing. The test suite card is stored in the e-shop
  cabinet.

  Connect serial cable to bee. At front of the BEE2, in the back 
  right is a 5 pin header labeled "RS232". The cable that converts 
  the 5 pin header to a DB9 port is stored in the e-shop cabinet.

    1) Plugged in the serial cable into a PC with a serial Putty 
    session, 115200 baud, and into the 5 pin header.
    2) Inserted the "Test Suite" card into the fron.
    3) Powered up the BEE2.
    4) After the boot finished types "set_eeprom". Aanswer the 
    questions. WiKi that explains what this does: 
      http://bee2.eecs.berkeley.edu/wiki/Bee2LinuxConfig.html
    5) The config line you will enter in set_eeprom is:

          console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200 nfsroot=/b2s/b02 ip=10.3.32.102:10.3.0.73:10.3.0.1:255.255.0.0:b02.bfa.hcro.org:eth0:off mem=512M rw root=/dev/nfs

      Note that you have to replace the IP address and bee id with the one of the 
      unit you are replacing (total of 3 items to replace).

    6) There are several other questions asked by set_eeprom. You have 
    to enter the MAC address, not just press enter.
    7) Power down. Leave the RS232 cable connected and the Putty 
    session active.
    8) Replace the card in front. insert the "Borph" card.
    9) Repower, plug into the network. Should now see it boot 
    successfully in the Putty window. Should be able to log in from tumulus.


Problems:

  Hangs/Reboots during FW loads - See JIRA 28,198,257,288,321
    Probable cause is the power connectors. Loading firmware is
    power intensive and possible cause of system crash.

  Bad Delay cals - 
    See JIRA ATA-198. Source could be a failed FPGA fan.

  Stopping on "Now booting the kernel"
    Confirm that the eeprom configurations are correct. Typos can cause such
    a failure.
