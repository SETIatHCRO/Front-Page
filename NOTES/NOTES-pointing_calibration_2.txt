AUTHOR: JR

These notes are to suppliment NOTES-pointing_calibration.txt. 
The medium and fine level adjustements have been improved with
the introduction of 2 new scripts:

pointingmodelcorr.rb - Calculates the best pointing model offsets and
  suggests the best arguments to atasetpmoffsets
tpoint_fit.rb - takes th output of atapointer and automatically creates 
  the new fit file, the pointing model coefficients. No need to do it
  by hand anymore.

III. Medium Level Adjustments

1) Run pointingmodelcorr.rb <ant list, comma separated>

  Syntax: pointingmodelcorr.rb <ant list, comma separated>
  Example: pointingmodelcorr.rb 1a,1b,1c

  It is best to run only on one node at a time. The program points to 
  GPS satellites. Occasionally there is not one available and you may have 
  to wait 10 or 20 minutes for one to rise.

  Output: A file named "corr.pnt" is appended to and contains as an example:

  Here is an explanation of each line of the output:

  Elev X contains the 5 power mensurements for the X pol along the elevation direction.
  Elev Y contains the 5 power mensurements for the Y pol along the elevation direction.
  Az X contains the 5 power mensurements for the X pol along the azimuth direction.
  Az Y contains the 5 power mensurements for the Y pol along the azimuth direction.
  Az/El is the azimuth and elevation of the antenna after the last power measurement.
  The first atasetpmoffsets is the original pm offsets of this dish.
  First set of offsets are calculated averaging the X and Y pol values. 
  XY New: the new pointing model offsets calulated suing the X/Y averages.
  XY Diff: the difference of this calculated pm offsets from the original.
  Cmd:      atasetpmoffsets --absolute ... is the command to apply this calculated offset.
  Second set of offsets are calculated just using the X pol power values. 
  X New: the new pointing model offsets calulated suing the X pol power values.
  X Diff: the difference of this calculated pm offsets from the original.
  Cmd:      atasetpmoffsets --absolute ... is the command to apply this calculated offset.
  Third set of offsets are calculated just using the Y pol power values. 
  X New: the new pointing model offsets calulated suing the Y pol power values.
  X Diff: the difference of this calculated pm offsets from the original.
  Cmd:      atasetpmoffsets --absolute ... is the command to apply this calculated offset.

  The output may seem a bit terse. What we really want is to just tell us the 
  atasetpmoffsets command to run. But there is problem with squint. Quite often one pol
  is good, the other is far off. That is because of squint. So, the operator has to
  decide which is the best atasetpmoffsets arguments to use.

  The "XY Diff" values are the degrees off the center pointing if you use both the X and
  Y pol differences together.
  The "X Diff" uses just the X pol to calculate the difference in degrees.
  The "Y Diff" uses just the Y pol to calculate the difference in degrees.

  In the above example the Y pol is MUCH better than the X pol, so use those offsets. To
  use the offsets you would issue the command:

    "atasetpmoffsets --absolute 1a 290.793138884239 77.7026651372184"

  and that is it, the pointing model offsets should be better adjusted. Although in this case the
  adjustments were really small. 

  Once the correct offsets have been applied, the dish is ready fro fine level adjusting
  using T-point.

  NOTES:
  1: Karto suggests it is best to use the best pol for the pointing model corrections.
     Gerry suggests using the X pol always.
  2: You may notice some squint, a few are quite bad. Use the pol with the smallest diff.
  3: The satellite selection only uses satellites above 40.0 degrees
      and rising, less than 60.0 degrees. Occasionally you 
      may have to wait till a satellite meets this condition.


IV. Fine Level adjustments

1) Setup observation using atapointer using fxa
    (source /hcro/atasys/ata/src/fxStreaming/atapointer2polIGS.java)

      - create and cd into directory for observations
      - initialize target antenna
        > fxconf.rb sagive <none|maint> fxa <ant>   ! get antenna into observing subarray
        > set-defaults.sh y fx64a              ! initialize fxa (only)
        > atasetskyfreq b 1575                      ! set observation freq.
        > atasetfocus <ant> 1575                     ! set focus 
        > atasetpams <ant> 37 37             ! JR - why 37?  Because of strong transmitter?

2) Run capture program
  
        > atapointer <file_suffix> <ant> A --lo b --freq 1575 --stophour <hh.x> -v

        NOTE - Refer to atapointer help for syntax, e.g., 18.0 for stop @ 6:00PM local time.
        Recommended that after an encoder change that a 4-8 hour collection be done, 
        but 3-4 hours will suffice.

3) Run tpoint_fit.rb

tpoint_fit.rb <dat file name>
The atapointer outputs 2 files, one for each pol named like: FXPointer_ant1e_y_1e.dat

Example:

> tpoint_fit.rb /setidata/data/2016/09/14/tpoint/FXPointer_ant3l_y_3l.dat
Input DAT file: /setidata/data/2016/09/14/tpoint/FXPointer_ant3l_y_3l.dat
Original RMS:   106.14, num points: 71
Fitted RMS:     34.79, num points: 54
FIT file:       FXPointer_ant3l_y_3l.fit
New DAT file:   FXPointer_ant3l_y_3l.dat_fit

In this case the antenna model parameters are in the file FXPointer_ant3l_y_3l.fit

Now update the existing fit file for this antenna. See 
http://log.hcro.org/content/radio-pointing-procedure for the procedure to manually
do this. Scroll down to the line that starts with
"Edit the original to match the parameters of the fit.".

Do the same for each pol dat file created by tpoint_fit.rb

Here is an example observation script
atasetalarm -a -u jrichards -m "Running atapointer on antenna 3l till 5pm"
fxconf.rb sagive none fxa 3l
#set-defaults.sh y fx64a
atasetskyfreq b 1575
atasetfocus 3l 1575
atasetpams 3l 37 37
sleep 10
atapointer 3l 3l A --lo b --freq 1575 --stophour 17.00 -v 2>&1 | tee 3l.log 
fxconf.rb sagive fxa none 3l
atasetalarm -a -u jrichards -m "Finished with antenna 3l"
