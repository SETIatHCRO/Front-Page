NOTES: OBSRI account notes
DATE: 2017-12-06  - mods to ensure obsri can run obs scripts

Obsri is an ldap-based user.
The obsri user is in the obs group. Most scripts allow obs group members full access.

- ENVIRONMENT:
   references to environment variable HOME will need to potentially be modified 
(hardcode to /home/obs or ~obs/)

- SSH:
  NB: protections on the ssh keys and config files should generally be 400
  obs scripts need to explicitly refer to the obs user for login (unless there
  is some compelling reason to use obsri for these subscripts - e.g., if they
  create files and we want to control ownership).

  Password-less login:
  1. in obsri account, generate obsri and fxsri key pairs for logins to
   obs hosts and correlator SBCs respectively.
  2. add the fxsri.pub to the fx obs authorized_keys
  (/data/boot2/ata/netboot/home/obs/.ssh
  3. add obsri.pub to the obs authorized_keys
  4. modify the obsri user ssh config:
      fx SBCs use fxsri identity file
      tumulus use obsri identity file
