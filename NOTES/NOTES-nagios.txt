10/7/15 Install of 4.1.1
4/15/16 Config of 4.1.1
--------------------------------------------
Nagios servxer:  on user2  accessed as http://nagios.hcro.org/nagios
  service nagios {start|restart|stop|reload, etc.}


Installation directory: /hcro/opt/nagios (on basalt)
	     NB: this dir translate to different locations depending
	     on machine architecture:
	     	/exports/basalt/hcro/Linux/x86_64/opt (all Dells, Suns)
		/exports/basalt/hcro/Linux/i386/opt  (basalt,cinder,caldera)
	     Primary install will be on the x86_64. Minimum of files kept
	     under the i386 in order to run NRPEs on those machines 

	     etc/objects	configuration files (servers, services)
	     libexec		scripts (bash, interpreted perl, etc.)

NRPE daemons:
     NRPEs run as standalone daemons on hosts (some may not be automatically 
     restarted):
	/hcro/opt/nagios/bin/nrpe -c /hcro/opt/nagios/etc/nrpe.cfg -d

Add users:
  > htpasswd2 /hcro/opt/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users

Administrator:
nagiosadmin/  berkeley

1/7/2014  ELK Change the var/rw directory access so that can access nagios.cmd 
(for external commands)
# EXTERNAL COMMAND FILE
# This is the file that Nagios checks for external command requests.
# It is also where the command CGI will write commands that are submitted
# by users, so it must be writeable by the user that the web server
# is running as (usually 'nobody').  Permissions should be set at the
# directory level instead of on the file, as the file is deleted every
# time its contents are processed.

 Web Interface Options:
 ------------------------
                 HTML URL:  http://localhost/nagios/
                  CGI URL:  http://localhost/nagios/cgi-bin/
 Traceroute (used by WAP):  /usr/sbin/traceroute

    

Make
	make all
	make install
	
Install
	make install-init
	     - this installs the init script in /etc/rc.d
	     -** Do this on all hosts (???)
	make install-commandmode
	     - this installs and configures permissions on the directory
	       holding the external command file
	     i.e., chmod g+s /hcro/opt/nagios/var/rw

	make install-config
	     - this installs example config files
	     ** MODIFY these files to meet needs.
	     	-nagios.cfg  -- change path to install

	make install-webconf
	     - this installs the apache config files for the nagios web if
	     ** do this ONLY on the web host server (user2)x

	cp -R contrib/eventhandlers/ ./libexec/
	chown -R nagios:nagios /hcro/opt/nagios/libexec/eventhandlers

Plug-Ins Install
----------------------------
	.configure --prefix=/hcro/opt/nagios ....
	make
	make install

Plug-in nrpe
	nrpe-2.15
	NOTE- there were compilation errors in nrpe.c related to SSL. Had to
	add a ifdef HAVE_SSL around much code to be able to use the
	disable-ssl. Also want to compile to allow user specified command
	arguments. Need to revisit whether we want to also allow bash command 
	substitution.LAstly, needed to compile on user2 as the bin is shared
	across multiple servers whose os level vary and can only rely on
	backward compatibility
	
	
	
	
	.configure --prefix=/hcro/opt/nagios --disable-ssl --enable-command-args ....
	make all
	make install

WEB Install
    NB - the /etc/apache2/conf.d/nagios.conf users the IfVersion syntax which
    requires the the apache mod_version module be enabled
    	     a2enmod version
    NB - since the nagios root (/hcro/opt/nagios) is a symbolic link, need to
    enable apache2 to follow symbolic links in the /hcro/opt directory (modify
    the /etc/apache2/conf.d/nagios.conf

    
    htpasswd2 -c /hcro/opt/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin
    service apache2 restart


GRAPHING - NAGIOSGRAPH, PNP4NAGIOS

https://sourceforge.net/projects/nagiosgraph/files/nagiosgraph/1.5.2/

NB - prior nagios install used nagiosgraph for graphs. Proved problematic.
   Switched to pnp4nagios

PNP4Nagios setup
  - Use Bulk Mode with NPCD (Nagios-Perfdata-C-Daemon) - provides an 
  asynchronous mode to hangle nagios performance data

  **** NB - this requires that the NPCD daemon be running along w/ nagios!!!!

  perfdata (written to /hcro/opt/nagios/var/host-perfdata and service-perfdata
  is moved to the spool directories under pnp4nagios
  (/hcro/opt/pnp4nagios/var/spool/host-perfdata.* and service-perfdata.* where 
  * is a timestamp).



HOST SETUP
---------------------
User account - create system account w/ no login directoy and create group at
same time (-U). Add user to group
     useradd -U -r -s /bin/false nagios
     /usr/sbin/usermod -G nagios nagios

Create a new nagcmd group for allowing external commands to be submitted
through the web interface (for nagios host only - user2). 
Add both the nagios user and the apache user to the group.

/usr/sbin/groupadd nagcmd
/usr/sbin/usermod -a -G nagcmd nagios
/usr/sbin/usermod -a -G nagcmd wwwrun

Use standalone daemon (the way most hosts are currently configured). 

SuSE Boot
     /etc/init.d/
SysV service management
      Add nrpe to the list of system services.have it automatically start when the system boots.

      chkconfig --add nrpe
      chkconfig nrpe on


tumulus:~ # systemctl status nrpe

Nagios Passive Checks:
 Nagios supports a way to monitor hosts and services passively instead of 
actively. Passive checks are initiated and performed by external 
applications/processes. Passive check results are submitted to Nagios for 
processing

1. An external application checks the status of a host or service.

2. The external application writes the results of the check to the external 
command file (/hcro/opt/nagios/var/rw/nagios.cmd)

3. The next time Nagios reads the external command file it will place the 
results of all passive checks into a queue for later processing. 

4. Nagios will periodically execute a check result reaper event and scan the 
check result queue. Each service check result that is found in the queue is 
processed in the same manner - regardless of whether the check was active or 
passive. Nagios may send out notifications, log alerts, etc. depending on the 
check result information.

Add atasys (on user2) to the nagcmd to allaow it to submit external commands
/ust/sbin/usermod -G nagcmd atasys
