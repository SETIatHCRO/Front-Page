I checked in on the feeds today, recording from noon until about 8:30 pm.  
ant4j was out of regulation during the day.  ant5b reached 240 watts and 
teetered on the edge of regulation ~ 3:30 in the afternoon.  
They are both fine this evening.  Weather Underground recorded temperatures in 
the high 70s Fahrenheit in Hat Creek this afternoon.

Best,
Rob
