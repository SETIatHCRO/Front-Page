Yes I think if you clean up the pins and use a new power cable you’ll be back in business.  If you see this 
issue on any further power cables I’d recommend you just let us know and we’ll replace it.  But if you 
want to give it a try to improve them that’s no problem either.

Thanks,
Cliff

Hi Cliff

Can we clean up the coolers pins & case & us it?
On any future cable connectors can we clean the excess molding away & use the cable?
