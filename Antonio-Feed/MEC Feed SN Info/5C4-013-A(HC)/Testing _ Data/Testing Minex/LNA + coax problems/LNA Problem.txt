Yes is was to improve contact. It was our experience with the new ones that it was not needed.

On the older lna’s, before the cooled feed you use to put indium between the cover & base plate.
Was that related to improving contact between the cover & base plate?
This will probably be the last question on this subject.

Hi Rob,
I doubt the center conductor would break in the middle of the line and if it happened I don’t think the 
LNA would oscillate, but I am not sure.
I was thinking that maybe the solder joint to the feed was bad, but I am guessing you have this under 
control.

If the LNA lids are in poor contact with the module, we could see oscillations. I am not sure what to 
advise you. I can guess that your attempts trying to solve the problem quickly become more expensive 
than the cost of the LNAs. Maybe you should pick two new LNAs and see if it solves the problem and 
then we decide what to do?

Hi Niklas
A couple of weeks ago we pulled the lna assemblies out, removed the covers & looked everything over 
under the microscope.
Soldering, traces, chips, components & wire bonds looked fine.

If there was a break in a center conductor of the 034 coax, inside the jacket, at 280K the center 
conductor ends where touching but by 70K they had moved apart.
Could this be happening, what would we see in testing?

Hi Rob,
Yes, I referred to the two input coaxial lines. Is it easy to see if they are attached on the feed side 
without having to take everything apart? I think that is where to look first anyway. It is possible that the 
lines would come off inside the LNA too. The connectorless solution is not the best.

Hi Niklas
This was a new build(5C4-016-A), attached are 2 screen images of the first hot/cold tests just after it was 
built, y pole only had poor performance.
We set this feed aside & concentrated on other feeds that would be going to Hat Creek RO.
After installing feeds at Hat Creek RO we took a 2nd look at -016 feed & that’s when out of the blue this 
all started.
You mentioned “coax not properly attached”, that would be the .034 input coax, not the output coax ?
I hope this info is of some help.

Hi Rob,
Sorry for the late reply. Looking at the pictures you attached it seems clear that the LNAs are oscillating. 
It’s very hard for me to guess why. Can you give some more information? Is this a feed that has been in 
operation that was returned due to problems or is it a newly built feed? I can imagine that you would 
get stability problems if one of the coaxial lines is not properly attached in either end, but there are 
many other possible reasons.

Hi Niklas
I hope you can help with this LNA problem.
I’m desperate to try and salvage 2 LNA’s in one of our Feeds.
When I build up a new Feed I check the LNA’s during the process.
Before we pumpdown & cooldown I do a quick check of the Feeds LNA’s in the Screen Room, in the hot 
load.
I use biasing similar to your 296K recommendations on the data sheets.
I remove the Feed from the Screen Room & back into the lab & I start the Pumpdown & Cooldown.
When the Feed is Pumpdown & Cooled I move it back to the Screen Room to check the LNA’s.
Here is when things have gone wrong.
Attached are some photos:
(1) is room temp & things look good.
(2) is X pole at 68K, biasing normal but low gain & lots of structure.
(3) is Y pole at 68K, low gain & lots of structure & if I adjust id above 20ma the trace drops off the 
screen.
(4) is both LNA’s bias adjusted to remove structure & best gain, but still overall low gain, a Hot/Cold test 
will be very low dB diff.
Other photos are of set-up.
We left the Feed in the hot load with the LNA’s on during warm-up, at 125K the structure went away on 
both LNA’s.
Do you have any ideas about what’s going on & what we could look for that’s causing this.
